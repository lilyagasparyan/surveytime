                            For this reason, children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the service without
                            supervision by a legal guardian. Please remember that the Services are designed to appeal to
                            a broad audience. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine

                            originated. This means that you, and not Surveytime, are entirely responsible for all
                            Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Services.
                            Surveytime does not control the Content posted via the Services and, as such, does not

                            the Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable.
                            Under no circumstances will Surveytime be liable in any way for any Content, including, but

                            in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via
                            the Services. Without limiting the foregoing, Surveytime and its designees shall have the
                            right to remove any Content that violates the Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You agree
                            that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content,
                            including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this
                            regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Surveytime or

                        <p>The sites displayed as search results or linked to by the Surveytime service are developed by
                            people over whom Surveytime exercises no control. The search results that appear from
                            Surveytime’s search engine partner’s indices are indexed by Surveytime search engine
                            partner’s automated machinery and computers, and Surveytime cannot and does not screen the
                            sites before including them in the indices from which such automated search results are
                            gathered. A search using the Surveytime service may produce search results and links to
                            sites that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. We cannot guarantee
                            that a Surveytime search will not locate unintended or objectionable content and assume no
                            responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise
                            linked to by the Surveytime Services. You may not take the results from a Surveytime search
                            and reformat and display them, or mirror the Surveytime home page or results pages on your
                            Web site. You may not “meta-search” Surveytime. If you are interested in adding a Surveytime
                            search box to your website or your company’s web site, please contact us. You shall not, and
                            shall not authorize or encourage any third party to directly or indirectly generate queries,
                            impressions of or clicks on any search results, links and/or ad(s) through any automated,
                            deceptive, fraudulent or other invalid means, including but not limited to through repeated

                        <p>Some search results and content at Surveytime and Surveytime Search may contain affiliate
                            links integrated into Surveytime search results. Every time you make a purchase or take
                            advantage of other relevant offers, the affiliate business will pay a commission to
                            Surveytime. This comes at no extra cost to the shopper. The affiliate businesses pay the
                            commissions generated by affiliate links. There is no extra cost for the user. Furthermore,
                            commission sums are not added to the purchase price of the product, but rather covered by
                            marketing costs that are generally built into the price of the product.</p>

                            same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for
                            copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights
                            under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed
                            on or through the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice
                            requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include
                            the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to
                            act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b)
